# pydatawrangler 🧠

A hands-on beginner-level data science project focused on **data wrangling and cleaning using pure Python** — without relying on external libraries like Pandas or NumPy.

This project demonstrates how to extract, clean, and process nested JSON data manually while simulating real-world data issues like missing values, duplicate records, and inactive users.

---

## 📌 Objective

To develop a foundational understanding of how raw, unstructured data can be cleaned, transformed, and used for analysis or recommendation logic — using only core Python.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Standard Library only)
- Jupyter Notebook
- JSON file handling
- Logic building without third-party tools

---

## 📁 Project Flow

| Notebook File                      | Input JSON File         | Purpose                          |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `01_introduction.ipynb`           | `data.json`              | Explore and visualize structure  |
| `02_data_cleaning.ipynb`          | `data2.json` → `cleaned_data2.json` | Manual data cleaning       |
| `03_people_you_may_know.ipynb`    | `massive_data.json`      | Recommend users using mutual friend logic |
| `04_pages_you_might_like.ipynb`   | `massive_data.json`      | Recommend pages using similarity logic |

---

## 🔍 Core Features

- Load and process nested JSON data
- Remove invalid users (missing names, empty connections)
- Eliminate duplicate pages and friend entries
- Generate simple friend and page recommendations using logic-based filtering
- Write cleaned data to a new JSON output file

---

## 🎯 Skills Practiced

- JSON file handling
- Python loops, conditions, and functions
- Data cleaning logic (without Pandas)
- File I/O
- Recommendation algorithms (rule-based)
